The COVID-19 outbreak is no different. At this point in the pandemic, we are unable to provide a clear answer to the question of the extent to which sex and gender are influencing the health outcomes of people diagnosed with COVID-19. However, experience and evidence thus far tell us that both sex and gender are important drivers of risk and response to infection and disease. \r\n\r\nIn order to understand the role gender is playing in the COVID-19 outbreak, countries urgently need to begin both collecting and publicly reporting sex-disaggregated data. At a minimum, this should include the number of cases and deaths in men and women.\r\n\r\nIn collaboration with CNN, Global Health 50/50 began compiling publicly available sex-disaggregated data reported by national governments to date and is exploring how gender may be driving the higher proportion of reported deaths in men among confirmed cases so far.\r\n\r\nFor more, please visit: http://globalhealth5050.org/covid19", "num_resources": 1, "num_tags": 7, "organization": {"id": "9f049545-2aea-4c55-b087-b70adc18bf77", "name": "global-health-50-50", "title": "Global Health 50/50 ", "type": "organization", "description": "Global Health 50/50 is an independent, evidence-driven initiative to advance action and accountability for gender equality in global health housed at The UCL Centre for Gender and Global Health.", "image_url": "", "created": "2020-04-08T09:10:18.303769", "is_organization": true, "approval_status": "approved", "state": "active"}, "overdue_date": "2022-07-13T12:31:16", "owner_org": "9f049545-2aea-4c55-b087-b70adc18bf77", "package_creator": "hdxmetasebya", "pageviews_last_14_days": 35, "private": false, "qa_checklist": "{\"modified_date\": \"2021-04-19T10:26:43.306603\", \"version\": 1, \"dataProtection\": {}, \"metadata\": {}}", "qa_completed": false, "review_date": "2022-05-30T12:31:16.211959", "solr_additions": "{\"countries\": [\"World\"]}", "state": "active", "subnational": "0", "title": "COVID-19 Sex-Disaggregated Data Tracker", "total_res_downloads": 1514, "type": "dataset", "url": null, "version": null, "groups": [{"description": "", "display_name": "World", "id": "world", "image_display_url": "", "name": "world", "title": "World"}], "tags": [{"display_name": "affected population", "id": "9f9d19d4-901f-4b57-b781-e6b2b56e2138", "name": "affected population", "state": "active", "vocabulary_id": "b891512e-9516-4bf5-962a-7a289772a2a1"}, {"display_name": "covid-19", "id": "4c4c6a4e-00b0-49b0-a1a5-e5082f91f6e6", "name": "covid-19", "state": "active", "vocabulary_id": "b891512e-9516-4bf5-962a-7a289772a2a1"}, {"display_name": "disaggregated by sex", "id": "f244c290-3707-488b-b5d9-9b015741a633", "name": "disaggregated by sex", "state": "active", "vocabulary_id": "b891512e-9516-4bf5-962a-7a289772a2a1"}, {"display_name": "epidemics and outbreaks", "id": "f09de763-f443-4165-8934-b51fe1a26840", "name": "epidemics and outbreaks", "state": "active", "vocabulary_id": "b891512e-9516-4bf5-962a-7a289772a2a1"}, {"display_name": "health", "id": "26fe3d20-9de7-436b-b47a-4f7f2e4547d0", "name": "health", "state": "active", "vocabulary_id": "b891512e-9516-4bf5-962a-7a289772a2a1"}, {"display_name": "hxl", "id": "a0fbb23a-6aad-4ccc-8062-e9ef9f20e5d2", "name": "hxl", "state": "active", "vocabulary_id": "b891512e-9516-4bf5-962a-7a289772a2a1"}, {"display_name": "infectious disease", "id": "31d2db34-c73e-45af-b302-6b00ab87ed5d", "name": "infectious disease", "state": "active", "vocabulary_id": "b891512e-9516-4bf5-962a-7a289772a2a1"}], "relationships_as_subject": [], "relationships_as_object": [], "is_fresh": true, "update_status": "fresh", "x_resource_grouping": [], "resources": [{"cache_last_updated": null, "cache_url": null, "created": "2020-09-18T15:59:25.444158", "datastore_active": false, "description": "The table reports the latest available sex-disaggregated data on confirmed cases and deaths across the countries currently included in the tracker.", "download_url": "https://globalhealth5050.org/?_covid-data=dataset-fullvars&_extype=csv", "format": "CSV", "hash": "", "hdx_rel_url": "https://globalhealth5050.org/?_covid-data=dataset-fullvars&_extype=csv", "id": "b367a072-8e39-4a45-8a16-378f20bef173", "last_modified": "2022-05-29T01:01:09.629045", "metadata_modified": "2022-05-29T04:53:40.093812", "microdata": false, "mimetype": null, "mimetype_inner": null, "name": "COVID-19 GH5050 Sex-disaggregated data tracker", "originalHash": -1625872065, "package_id": "c7f9e76d-4afb-469a-a256-519b1901e6dd", "pii_report_flag": "QUEUED", "position": 0, "resource_type": "api", "size": 0, "state": "active", "upload": null, "url": "https://globalhealth5050.org/?_covid-data=dataset-fullvars&_extype=csv", "url_type": "api"}]}
