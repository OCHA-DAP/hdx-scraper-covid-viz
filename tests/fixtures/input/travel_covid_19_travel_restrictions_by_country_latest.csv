*Exemptions: Exemptions to quarantine arrangements are issued on an exceptional and case by case basis. Travellers should contact the Bangladesh High Commission or Bangladesh authorities in advance of travel to discuss any possible exemptions. <br>
*Children and young people: There is no requirement for children under 12 to present a negative RT PCR COVID-19 test result. Children under 12 should follow the same regime that applies to those family members they are travelling with, regardless of their vaccination status. <br>
*If you’re transiting through Bangladesh: Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination. <br>
For those planning to transit through Bangladesh on your way to another country, visas for Bangladesh are not required for those remaining airside at the airport. However, we have been unable to confirm that COVID-19 measures do not apply, and we would recommend meeting the Government of Bangladesh’s COVID-19 requirements. For example, unvaccinated travellers may wish to ensure that they have a negative PCR test result, taken no more than 72 hours of their departure, and familiarise themselves with any airline requirements, together with those of the final destination.<br>
 <br>
<br> <br> 
Internal Restrictions:<br>
On 12 January, the Bangladesh authorities announced a number of new measures in response to the Omicron coronavirus variant. This includes wearing masks in public spaces, capacity restrictions in public settings, including on public transport, a requirement to show vaccination status in some settings and the introduction of rapid antigen testing for international arrivals. <br>
*Moving around in Bangladesh: Public transport, including domestic flights, is operating. However COVID related travel restrictions may come into force at short notice and you should check local guidance and media reports for the latest developments.<br>
*Face masks must be worn at all times when moving in and around Bangladesh. Anyone not complying with these requests risks legal action.<br>
*Businesses and services: Businesses, including shops, offices and banking services, have largely resumed operations with minimal restrictions.<br>
*Accommodation: Hotels and guesthouses are operating. Check with your travel or accommodation provider for available options..

International Restrictions: <br>
*Entry to Barbados: Barbados has published travel protocols setting out its entry requirements in relation to COVID-19. See the <a href=""https://www.visitbarbados.org/covid-19-travel-guidelines-2020"">Visit Barbados website</a> for full details. You should read these before your departure and monitor the pages on a regular basis as the requirements may change at short notice. Masks should be worn at all times during your travel to Barbados and your passage through the airport. Social distancing and hygiene protocols are in place. <br>
*If you’re fully vaccinated: Fully vaccinated people (2 doses administered more than 14 days prior to arrival or single dose where only one dose administered) are not required to complete a pre-arrival COVID-19 test and will not be subject to testing* or quarantine on arrival. Once you have completed a health check and your documentation (proof of vaccination status) has been validated, you will be free to move around Barbados unhindered. <br>
*A number of fully vaccinated arrivals will be randomly chosen to have a rapid antigen test. There is no requirement to quarantine, as the result will be made available very quickly. See the <a href=""https://www.visitbarbados.org/covid-19-travel-guidelines-2020"">Barbados Travel Protocols  </a> for further details. <br>
Details of what the Barbadian authorities will accept as proof of vaccination can be found in the <a href=""https://www.visitbarbados.org/covid-19-travel-guidelines-2020"">Barbados Travel Protocols</a>

•        a valid Rapid PCR COVID-19 negative test result taken one day before arrival in Barbados <br>
•        a valid Rapid Antigen negative test result taken one day before arrival in Barbados <br>
Accepted tests include tests which were taken at an approved or recognised laboratory by a healthcare provider via a nasopharyngeal sample, oropharyngeal sample, nasal sample, anterior nares samples or mid-turbinate sample. Your test certificate should provide this information. LAMP tests, shallow nasal swab samples, self-administered tests or home kits or tests using saliva samples will not be accepted.

You will need to remain in your hotel room and may be required to wear an electronic tracking bracelet until you receive the results of your second test. The government aims to return results within 48 hours, although return times can sometimes be longer than this. If the result of that second test is negative, you will not be subject to further quarantine. The government recommends that you book 5 nights’ accommodation. See the <a href=""https://www.visitbarbados.org/covid-19-travel-guidelines-2021"">Barbados Travel Protocols </a> for full details.<br>

*Travel in Barbados: Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in Barbados to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19). Details of these measures can be found at the <a href=""https://gisbarbados.gov.bb/"">
Barbados Government Information Service website</a> and / or <a href=""https://m.facebook.com/gisbarbados/?tn-str=k%2AF&_rdr"">Facebook page</a> and the <a href=""https://www.visitbarbados.org/covid-19-travel-guidelines-2020"">Visit Barbados Travel Protocols</a>.
The Government’s COVID-19 protocols may be subject to change at short notice and you should therefore review these regularly. <br>
All persons arriving in Barbados are required to wear face masks at all times whilst on airport grounds. Persons will also have their temperature taken. In moving around Barbados, follow social distancing protocols. <br>
Masks are mandatory in all indoor public spaces and on public transport. You can expect to have your temperature taken and you may be asked to supply your contact details when entering some premises. Regular washing of hands is encouraged and you can expect to be asked to clean your hands using hand sanitizer on entering a building. <br>
You may be required to quarantine and/or undergo a further COVID-19 test at any stage of your stay if the Barbados authorities deem that you have been in close contact with a COVID-19 positive individual or mandatory monitoring highlights potential COVID-19 symptoms. <br>
The Barbadian authorities will seek to prosecute people who breach COVID-19 protocols, including those who break quarantine protocols, which may result in a fine and/or prison sentence. <br>
*If you test positive for COVID-19, you will be assessed by a member of staff from the government’s quarantine facilities for 24 hours. You may be transferred to the Government’s quarantine facility, Harrison’s Point, for further assessment and treatment. You can stay there for no cost until you have recovered. Conditions at the government quarantine facilities are generally basic and not necessarily equivalent to a tourist hotel with the associated services. Visitors will have to remain on the island until they have fully recovered and returned a negative COVID-19 test. Visitors should ensure they have sufficient travel and medical insurance to cover additional costs in this eventuality. <br>
Alternatively, you may be eligible for the Government’s home isolation programme and you have the option of requesting to self-isolate at your own expense at a government-approved isolation hotel, villa or property until you have recovered. Strict rules are in place for this self-isolation. The option to self-isolate in an approved hotel, villa or property is not a right – the decision will be made by healthcare professionals. Visitors will have to remain on the island until they have fully recovered and returned a negative COVID-19 test. Visitors should ensure they have sufficient travel and medical insurance to cover additional costs in this eventuality.

Requirements apply: <br>
You must have proof of a recent (no older than 72 hours before first boarding) negative coronavirus PCR test to board your flight to Cameroon and to enter at Yaoundé or Douala Airports. <br>
The Government of Cameroon demands a negative Coronavirus PCR test from all travellers aged five and above. (Some airlines demand a PCR test from travellers aged two and above, so check with your airline.) <br>
Your negative coronavirus test result should be in PDF format, clearly stating the date of the test and the type of test (which should be PCR). Electronic copies are accepted.You should arrange to take a private test. <br>
*Testing/screening on arrival: All international travellers are subjected to extra, rapid flow, testing for Coronavirus on arrival at Yaoundé and Douala international airports. This is the Rapid Flow test. At present this includes all passengers arriving in Cameroon. These tests are compulsory. Results are returned while passengers are at the airport. There is no fee. <br>
This is in addition to the requirement to have a negative PCR test 72 hours before embarkation on the first leg of your journey to Cameroon. <br>
*Quarantine requirements: If you have a proof of a recent (no older than 72 hours before boarding) negative coronavirus test, you will normally not have to self-isolate. Anyone that has developed symptoms of Coronavirus on their travel or tests positive on arrival at Yaoundé or Douala airport will be held for further enquiries to trace contacts and movements. We believe that anyone testing positive can quarantine at the location of your host or private accommodation until a negative PCR test is produced. These requirements are regularly evolving. <br>
*Exit Requirements: All travellers leaving Cameroonian territory must present a negative PCR or a rapid flow test result at the airport from the last 72 hours. We strongly advise that you take a PCR test, with a QR barcode. Your country of destination or transit may have other requirements. <br>

*If you’ve had COVID-19 in the past year: If you’ve recovered from COVID-19, you still need at least 2 doses of an accepted COVID-19 vaccine, a mix of 2 accepted vaccines or 1 dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine to enter Canada for discretionary (non-essential) purposes. <br>
If you’ve only had one dose of an accepted vaccine other than Janssen (Johnson & Johnson), you don’t qualify for the fully vaccinated traveller exemption. <br>
*Children and young people: Children aged 12 to 17 years must follow the rules for fully vaccinated travellers to enter Canada. Unvaccinated and partially vaccinated children aged 12 to 17 are subject to the 14-day quarantine, and all testing requirements for pre-entry, arrival and Day-8 tests, whether or not they are accompanied by travellers who qualify as a fully vaccinated traveller. <br>
Unvaccinated asymptomatic travellers 12 years of age and over are not required to quarantine upon entering Canada if they meet have a medical contraindication against getting a COVID-19 vaccine and comply with certain measures. See <a href=""https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/awareness-resources/travellers-over-12-without-symptoms-medically-exempt-vaccination.html"">Public Health Canada’s website for further information</a>. <br>
Unvaccinated or partially vaccinated children aged 11 and under accompanied by a partially vaccinated or unvaccinated adult must complete pre-entry, arrival and Day-8 tests, unless you have evidence that the child had a positive COVID-19 test taken 14 to 180 days prior to arrival in Canada or the child is aged 4 and under.

Further details are available on the <a href=""https://travel.gc.ca/travel-covid/travel-restrictions/covid-vaccinated-travellers-entering-canada#children"">Government of Canada’s travel pages</a>. <br>
If you qualify as a fully vaccinated traveller, your unvaccinated or partially vaccinated children aged 11 and under will be exempt from taking a pre-departure test and quarantine, without any limitations on their activities, and are no longer required to produce a quarantine plan. This means, for example, they no longer need to wait 14 days before attending school, camp or day care. <br>
Adults travelling with fully vaccinated children between the ages of 5 to 11 have the option to upload their proof of vaccination into ArriveCAN. <br>
The benefit of uploading the child’s proof is that if they are travelling with an adult who does not qualify as fully vaccinated, the child will qualify for an exemption from quarantine and mandatory testing on Day 1 and Day 8. <br>

  Internal Restrictions:<br> 
*Travel in Canada: To help curb the spread of coronavirus, provincial governments have introduced a number of measures. There are some regional variations, but they generally include: <br>
•        limit on numbers in bars and restaurants and at large gatherings in affected cities and regions <br>
•        mandatory wearing of face masks in indoor public settings <br>

In order to receive a Health Declaration Form from the Chinese Embassy you must provide evidence of a negative nucleic acid test seven days before you travel, followed by a negative nucleic acid and an IgM antibody test for COVID-19 taken no more than 48 hours before you travel. <br>
Reports of both your nucleic acid (COVID-19) and IgM (antibody) tests must come from the same service provider. This does not mean the provider must carry out both tests, but that the provider must guarantee both test reports. You should arrange to take a private test from one of the eligible providers listed on the <a href=""https://www.mfa.gov.cn/ce/ceuk/eng/visa/jiankangmaEn/t1854940.htm""> Embassy website</a>.
A limited number of international flights from other countries are flying into Beijing. Other international passenger flights to Beijing continue to be diverted to 16 designated airports in Chengdu, Changsha, Hefei, Lanzhou, Tianjin, Shijiazhuang, Taiyuan, Hohhot, Jinan, Qingdao, Nanjing, Shenyang, Dalian, Zhengzhou, Xi’an and Wuhan. A small number of international flights are also operating direct between European cities and Shanghai, Guangzhou and Qingdao. <br>
Demonstrating your COVID-19 vaccination status: China has not yet confirmed that it will accept the solutions for demonstrating your COVID vaccination status. You should follow guidance for alternative entry requirements. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination. <br>
Health checks on arrival: All international arrivals will be subject to PCR testing on arrival, during and after quarantine. Even asymptomatic carriers will be isolated in a Covid hospital until they return at least three consecutive negative results. There have been some cases of individuals testing intermittently positive for a number of weeks. Travellers with a history of COVID-19 infection should consider leaving a gap between an infection and travel to China. All travellers should take precautions before and during travel to minimise as far as possible the chances of testing positive on arrival. <br>
Health regulations surrounding passengers arriving from overseas are continuously changing. You should contact the Chinese embassies before you travel if you have any questions regarding these entry requirements, quarantine rules or the requirements for individual cities. <br>
Quarantine requirements: Following health checks on arrival, you will then need to enter quarantine for at least 14 days. At some points of entry children 14 and over will be required to quarantine alone irrespective of whether they test positive or negative for COVID. <br>
You may be separated from your child if one of you tests positive for coronavirus. Whilst we cannot prevent this, if it happens to you or is about to happen, you can call your consular assistance. Non-residents may be charged for their care.<br> 
Quarantine is usually spent at either a centralised government hotel (with costs covered by the traveller) or your home. Quarantine requirements can change at short notice and may differ from province to province. <br>
Follow-up swab tests are likely to take place during your quarantine period. Family members of someone who tests positive, or those who have been in close contact, will need to go into a government quarantine hospital.<br>
For all quarantine arrangements in China: <br>
•        unless directed by the authorities you’re not allowed to leave your designated quarantine location for 14 days. This means you’re also unable to leave China for the duration of the quarantine <br>
•        depending on the quarantine location, facilities may be basic: there may be no fridge, no air-conditioning, and limited or no internet/wifi <br>
•        during your stay you will be responsible for cleaning the room<br>
•        if meals are not available at the quarantine location, you will need to arrange food orders for delivery from outside <br>
•        larger sized families with two parents may be separated into 2 rooms. <br>
•        if you’re on prescription medication make sure you bring enough with you to last for at least 3-4 weeks together with medical documents certifying that you need to take this medication. <br>
Failure to comply with the quarantine conditions or testing put in place, or any attempts to deliberately conceal health conditions can result in being sentenced to up to three years in prison. This applies to both Chinese and foreign nationals. <br>
After quarantine: Following quarantine, you will need to obtain a green QR health code in order to secure accommodation. In cities with lockdowns, many hotels no longer accept new guests, including those who have recently arrived into China and completed mandatory quarantine. Before arriving into China, you should ensure you have confirmed your accommodtion following your mandatory quarantine <br>
  <br>
  <br> 
Internal Restrictions: <br> 
*Travel in China: Mandatory requirements to check temperatures and use health kit apps or scan QR codes to prove travel history are in place at transport hubs, hotels, commercial buildings including restaurants, residential compounds and other locations. Restrictions on movement and quarantine arrangements remain for travel between different parts of the country. Some cities and provinces need travellers from high to medium risk areas to undergo 14 days of isolation in their place of residence or in centralised observation. Quarantine is enforced at the neighbourhood level and procedures vary, so check in advance.<br>
The possibility that local authorities impose mandatory lockdowns in response to fresh outbreaks is high. Such lockdowns may result in disruptions to medical and other basic services, including food delivery. You should ensure you have prepared additional food, water and medical supplies in case you are mandated to isolate at home. There have been reports of individuals who have frequented bars or restaurants where there have been confirmed cases of COVID-19 being mandated to undergo 14 days of centralised quarantine. You should keep up to date with the latest developments and this travel advice, including requirements for evidence of a negative COVID-19 NAT test within 48 hours of travel from high to medium risk areas. <br>
There have been reports of discrimination against foreign nationals in China as a result of a perceived risk that they might re-import COVID-19.<br>

International Restrictions:<br> 
*Entry to Côte d’Ivoire: Biometric in-person visa services at the Côte d’Ivoire Embassies are suspended due to COVID-19. Anyone wishing to enter Côte d’Ivoire who does not already have a visa should make their visa application through the <a href=""https://snedai.com/e-visa/"">e-visa service online  </a> before travel, available in English. If you are not an ECOWAS national, you must hold a valid visa or have had your application for an e-visa approved for Côte d’Ivoire before you travel. <br>
After registering and paying online, you’ll be able to collect your visa on arrival at Abidjan airport. You’ll need to apply for the e-visa online several days before your date of travel to allow time for your application to be processed. Make sure you follow instructions on the website carefully to avoid any difficulties with airlines or immigration authorities. <br>
*Demonstrating your COVID-19 status: Côte d’Ivoire will accept the  proof of COVID-19 vaccination record. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status; you should instead ideally ensure you travel with your electronic vaccination certificate containing the QR code. <br>
*Testing / screening for arrivals: If you are arriving in Côte d’Ivoire, with effect from 7 March 2022, the Ministry of Health, Public Hygiene and Universal Health Coverage has announced that you no longer need to show a negative PCR test as long as you can prove that you are fully vaccinated. If you are not fully vaccinated, you will still need to show evidence of a negative COVID-19 test result, dated a maximum of 72 hours prior to arrival, before being allowed to board your flight. You should arrange to take a private test. You’ll also need to complete the DDVA form prior to arrival at a cost of 2000 XOF, available <a href=""https://deplacement-aerien.gouv.ci/#/home"">online</a>.
You’ll need to hand in this form on arrival and comply with the medical monitoring system, which has been put in place by the authorities for anyone arriving in Côte d’Ivoire from outside. This includes providing temperature readings and registering your contact details. <br>
As of January 2022, all inbound air travellers may be subject to additional measures to control the spread of COVID-19. This includes mandatory antigen testing upon arrival at the airport for those who cannot prove that they are fully vaccinated. For those who are not fully vaccinated and undergo this further antigen testing on arrival at the airport, the government may monitor inbound travellers’ health status for five days by calling or texting their mobile phones. You may be monitored by SMS tracking for 14 days. Measures are subject to frequent review and may change at short notice, so travellers should check the <a href=https://deplacement-aerien.gouv.ci/#/home"""">government’s official site</a> for updates. <br>
*Transiting Côte d’Ivoire: You will not require a visa for any airside transit. <br>
*Quarantine requirements: You may be advised to self-isolate in your own accommodation for 14 days on arrival in Côte d’Ivoire. <br>

 Internal Restrictions: <br>
*Travel in Cuba: Travel and transport within and between Provinces varies according to the COVID-19 measures in place. Any change in the COVID-19 situation in a province or municipality may mean inter-provincial or municipal transport links also change and curfews may be imposed. <br>
Face masks must be worn at all times when travelling on buses, in taxis, and private hire vehicles. <br>
Visitors are allowed to hire cars but should check with the hire companies if they are open, have cars available, and where you can drive to under current COVID-19 measures, before making plans. <br>
Check with your tour operator and seek local advice if you have questions about excursions to other parts of Cuba, including whether car hire is allowed. <br>

 International Restrictions: <br>
*All travellers: If you are a foreign passport holder visiting Ecuador for up to 90 days, you do not need a visa. If you plan to stay longer, you should consult the <a href=""https://www.cancilleria.gob.ec/"">nearest Ecuadorean Embassy</a> before travelling. On entry, you may be asked about your reason for travel, and asked to provide evidence of a return or onward flight/bus ticket.

The land border with Peru remains closed. However, Ecuadorean nationals and foreign residents may be allowed to enter Ecuador, via the Huaquillas southern border checkpoint. The land border with Colombia opened in December 2021 to all travellers, but only through the ‘Rumichaca’ international checkpoint, from 8am to 5pm. <br>
Most ports remain closed for travel/tourism activities. As of October 2021, international cruise ship operations are permitted in Esmeraldas, Guayaquil, Manta and Puerto Baquerizo ports. <br>
International commercial flights are operating to and from Ecuador. However, we highly recommend you to contact your airline/travel company to check your travel itinerary, in case of any last minute COVID-19-related changes. <br>

*Quarantine requirements: If, on arrival, a passenger presents COVID-19 related symptoms, they will be evaluated by a Ministry of Public Health (MSP) representative, prior to entering the immigration control area. Suspected cases of COVID-19 will be required to take a rapid antigen test. If the result is positive, the passenger will be instructed to self-isolate for 10 days. <br>
Non-residents must self-isolate in a hotel at their own expense.

*If you’re fully vaccinated: Passengers age 12 and over who have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19 more than two weeks before the date of entry are required to show evidence of this. Accepted vaccinations are a single dose of Johnson and Johnson, or two doses for Astra-Zeneca, Sinopharm, Sinovac, Moderna and Pfizer. <br>
Travellers under the age of 12 do not need to show proof of vaccination.
*If you’re not fully vaccinated: If you’re not fully vaccinated, you’ll need to show proof of a negative COVID-19 RT PCR test result issued within the 72 hours (3 days) before departure, or a rapid lateral flow test up to 24 hours before arriving in Ethiopia. A lateral flow test must be certified by a testing centre and not self administered. Pre-departure tests are not required for passengers under the age of 12 or diplomats. You may need to demonstrate you have such a test certificate before boarding your flight.
You should arrange to take a private test. 
If you’ve had COVID-19 in the past 90 days: If you’re not fully vaccinated but have tested positive for COVID-19 you can enter Ethiopia if you have certificate of recovery from within the last 90 days or evidence of vaccination as above.

After health screening and immigration you will then need to present your hotel details and passport to the desk marked “transit shuttle bus” from where you will be taken to the hotel. You will not be able to leave the hotel during your transit. To the extent airline schedules allow, you should therefore minimise the duration of your transit in Addis Ababa. <br>

<br>
Internal Restrictions: <br>
*Travel in France: From Monday 16 May, wearing masks on public transport is no longer compulsory. Wearing masks on public transport remains recommended, especially for vulnerable people. <br>
Some travel operators such as airlines may specify types of masks to be worn on board e.g. surgical masks, and may encourage you to take spares for long journeys. Please check with your travel operator before travelling.<br>
There are no internal travel restrictions in France; however, measures may change at short notice either at national or at local level. You should visit the <a href=""https://www.gouvernement.fr/info-coronavirus"">French Government Coronavirus Information page</a>   or use the ‘TousAntiCovid’ digital app for further information and to stay up to date on restrictions<br>
*Public spaces and services: Face masks are mandatory in all health establishments (hospitals, clinics, retirement homes, nursing homes and assisted living, as well as establishments for people with disabilities).<br>
-Pass sanitaire (health pass): The pass sanitaire is currently required to access the following places:<br>
•        Hospitals, clinics, social/medical health care establishments<br>
•        Retirement homes, nursing homes, independent and assisted-living residences<br>
•        Establishments for people with disabilities<br>
You can find more information on requirements and how to <a href=""https://www.gouvernement.fr/info-coronavirus/pass-sanitaire"">access the “pass sanitaire” from the French Government</a>.<br>
You can get the pass sanitaire by fulfilling one of the following three criteria:<br>
1.        A vaccination certificate (see details on proof of vaccination below), or<br>
2.        A negative PCR or antigen result from a test taken within the last 24 hours, or<br>
3.        A document (dated more than 11 days ago and less than six months ago) proving you have recently recovered from COVID.<br>
Children under 12 are exempt from ‘pass sanitaire’ requirements.<br>
*Proof of vaccination: The French Government recognises vaccination certificates that conform to EU norms. This means:<br>
•        7 days after a third dose of Oxford/AstraZeneca, Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, and Novavax for domestic use (to obtain a valid “health pass”), or<br>
•        28 days after a second dose of Johnson & Johnson, or<br>
•        7 days after a second injection for those able to demonstrate they have already been infected (this only applies to those vaccinated in France) for domestic use (to obtain a valid “vaccine pass”)<br>
Since 15 February 2022, anyone aged over 18 years and 1 month needs to have received a booster dose within 4 months of the initial course (or after infection for those vaccinated in France) to be considered fully vaccinated for domestic purposes (i.e. to use the pass sanitaire). If the pass deactivates because you have not received a booster within 4 months of the initial course, you can reactivate it by receiving a booster dose.<br>
COVID-19 testing in France
If you have a prescription from a French medical practitioner or are identified as having been in contact with someone who has a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, supervised COVID-19 tests remain free as long as you present a valid Insurance Card. Travellers outside these circumstances will need to pay for a COVID-19 test. The minimum cost of supervised COVID-19 tests in France is €44 for PCR tests and €22 for rapid antigen tests. Self-administered rapid antigen tests can be purchased from pharmacies. The process for accessing these tests in France is via a list of places available from the <a href=""https://www.sante.fr/cf/carte-depistage-covid.html"">French government website</a>.

*Accommodation: All hotels are permitted to open, and other types of accommodation, including e.g. Airbnb, private rentals and hostels, are also available.

You should check directly with your accommodation provider in case of related concerns. <br>
*Public spaces and services: All restrictions remain under regular review. In Regional Units (περιφερειακές ενότητες) where the spread of COVID-19 is particularly high and hospital capacity is limited, restrictions may be tighter or re-imposed with limited notice. Check the latest local guidance and follow the advice of local authorities. <br>

•        items that can be taken in to government quarantine centres are restricted. There is no smoking allowed and no alcohol. Depending on your centre, facilities may be basic: there may be no fridge and no air-conditioning and you may need to share a room <br>

Your last vaccine dose must have been administered at least 14 days prior to travel. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status. Children under the age of 12 who are not vaccinated will be allowed to enter with a fully vaccinated accompanying adult. <br>
Travellers arriving to Hong Kong will need to provide a negative nucleic acid test result for COVID-19, taken no more than 48 hours prior to their departure.

From 1 June, you will no longer need a separate certificate confirming that the testing laboratory meets the required standards. <br>
Travel between Hong Kong, Macao and mainland China: All border crossings with mainland China remain closed indefinitely, with the exception of the Shenzhen Bay Checkpoint and the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge. All passengers wanting to board a shuttle bus to cross the bridge departing from Hong Kong to Macao must present a certificate confirming that they have tested negative for COVID-19 within 72 hours of their departure. The special ferry service between Taipa Ferry Terminal in Macao and Hong Kong International Airport has now ceased operations.

<a href=""https://www.coronavirus.gov.hk/eng/return2hk-scheme.html"">Hong Kong SAR government coronavirus website</a>.
*If you’re not fully vaccinated: If you are not fully vaccinated and have visited places outside mainland China, Macao or Taiwan within the past 14 days, you will be denied entry into Hong Kong. <br>
If you are unable to be fully vaccinated due to medical reasons, you may still be permitted entry to Hong Kong, but will be required to undergo 14 days quarantine in a designated quarantine hotel. You will be required to show proof of the relevant medical reason certified by a medical practitioner before boarding a flight to Hong Kong. <br>
Children under the age of 12 who are not vaccinated will be allowed to enter with a vaccinated accompanying adult. <br>
If you’ve had COVID-19 in the past year: If you have previously infected with Covid-19 and have received one dose of COVID-19 vaccine, you will be considered fully vaccinated. <br>
*Children and young people: Proof of a single dose of the BioNTech vaccination will be accepted for 12-17 year-old Hong Kong residents entering Hong Kong and for non-Hong Kong residents from 1 May. <br>
Unvaccinated minors under the age of 12 will also be permitted entry to Hong Kong if they are travelling with fully vaccinated adults who meet the requirements. They will be subject to the same quarantine and testing requirements as the adults accompanying them. <br>
Children 12-17 years of age who meet the vaccination requirements and are travelling alone will also need to quarantine for 7 days on arrival in a designated hotel.

*If you’re transiting through Hong Kong: Transit services at Hong Kong International Airport resumed on 1 April. <br>
Transiting through Hong Kong from, but not to, mainland China is now allowed. <br>
From 1 June, transit passengers travelling through Hong Kong International Airport will no longer be required to provide evidence of a pre-departure PCR test before boarding their flight to Hong Kong. If in doubt, you should check with your travel agent or airline before travelling and check the <a href=""https://www.hongkongairport.com/"">Hong Kong International Airport website</a>.
There is a risk when transiting that you will be placed into isolation in hospital in Hong Kong or a government quarantine facility. All passengers transiting Hong Kong Inter-national Airport will be subject to advanced screening measures, including temperature checks. Passengers deemed to have a high temperature will undergo further checks by the Port Health Office at the airport. If you meet further risk criteria, you will be transferred to a Hong Kong public hospital for mandatory checks/treatment, where it is highly likely you will be asked to complete a mandatory COVID-19 test. If you successfully pass health screening you need to sit in designated areas at boarding gates and use designated queues in dining facilities and shops, in line with Hong Kong International Airport anti-virus measures. <br>

 <a href=""https://www.gov.il/en/departments/ministry_of_health"">Ministry of Health</a>/","Latest News: Authorities will end mandatory COVID-19 testing for arrivals at Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion Airport from 20 May (Reuters, 08.05.2022).
  <br>
  <br>
International Restrictions:<br>
*All travellers: You don’t need a visa to enter Israel/The Occupied Palestinian Territories as a tourist. On entry, visitors are granted permission to stay for a period of up to 3 months. <br>
Visitors entering via Tel Aviv Ben Gurion Airport are given an entry card instead of an entry stamp in their passport. While this practice is in place at other ports of entry, there have been instances where passports have been stamped for entry purposes. You should keep your entry card with your passport until you leave. This is evidence of your legal entry into Israel and may be required, particularly at any crossing points into the Occupied Palestinian Territories. If you’re refused entry into Israel, your passport may be stamped with an entry stamp and two red lines drawn across it to indicate the refusal.
It is for the Israeli authorities to decide if you can enter Israel. If you have any particular concerns about visas or entry into Israel, you should contact the Israeli embassy. If you work in Israel without the proper permissions, you can be detained and then deported, a process which could take several months. Consular staff will not be able to help you enter Israel or the Occupied Palestinian Territories. They are unable get involved in another country’s immigration policy or procedures. <br>
At the Allenby Bridge crossing with Jordan, and at Tel Aviv Ben Gurion Airport, Israeli border officials have sometimes used an entry stamp for certain travellers that states ‘Palestinian Authority only’ or ‘Judea and Samaria only’. Since travellers entering via the Allenby Bridge crossing must pass through Israeli checkpoints and Israeli-controlled territory to reach Jerusalem or Gaza, this restriction effectively limits travellers who receive this stamp. It is not clear how a traveller receiving the stamp at Tel Aviv Ben Gurion Airport can leave the airport without violating the restriction. This stamp has been issued to travellers who have no Palestinian or other Arab ancestry, and who would not seem to have any claim to a Palestinian Authority ID. <br>
Israeli border officials at Tel Aviv Ben Gurion Airport have also at times required certain travellers to sign a form that states that he/she is not allowed to enter territories controlled by the Palestinian Authority unless he/she obtains advance authorisation from the Israeli ‘Territory Actions Co-ordinator’, and that violating this restriction may result in the traveller being deported from Israel and barred from entry for up to 10 years. In March 2017 the Israeli Parliament passed a law which gives authority to deny entry to foreign nationals who have publicly called for a boycott of Israel and/or settlements, or who belong to an organisation which has called for a boycott. if you need further information. <br>
Emergency Travel Documents: Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are not valid for entry into Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories unless the holder is a returning resident. However, ETDs are accepted for airside transit and exit from Israel. <br>
Previous Travel to Other Countries: Evidence of a previous visit to another country in the region like an entry/exit stamp in your passport does not normally prevent entry into Israel, although it may lead to additional questioning at the border. It is for the Israeli authorities to determine the right of entry into Israel, so if you have any particular concerns about previous travel to another country, you should contact the nearest Israeli Embassy. <br>
Customs and Immigration: You should expect lengthy personal questioning and baggage searches by security officials on arrival and departure from Israel. Electrical items, including laptops, may be taken from departing passengers for security inspection and either stored in the aircraft baggage hold, or returned to your country. Damage may occur. <br>
If you arrive with valuable personal items (computers, camcorders etc.) you may be required to pay a deposit that is refundable on or after departure. <br>
Israeli security officials have on occasion requested access to travellers’ personal e-mail accounts or other social media accounts as a condition of entry. <br>
Foreign nationals of Palestinian origin: If you’re a foreign national of Palestinian origin (on the Palestinian Population Register or holding a Palestinian ID number), you will need a Palestinian passport or travel document in order to leave. If you are a Foreign national with a Palestinian name or place of birth but without a Palestinian ID number, you may face problems. A number of Foreign nationals of Palestinian origin or foreign nationals married to Palestinians have been refused entry to the country. <br>
Dual nationals: Foreign-Palestinian dual nationals living in the West Bank and Gaza are allowed to travel abroad only via the Rafah or Allenby Bridge border crossings into Egypt or Jordan and return via the same route. <br>
Children with Israeli parents (father and/or mother) are considered to be Israeli nationals. The Israeli Ministry of Interior insists that these children enter and leave Israel on an Israeli passport. <br>
*If you’re fully vaccinated: If you’re fully vaccinated, you can enter Israel. No proof of vaccination is required. <br>

Internal Restrictions: <br>
As Italy continues its transition out of the state of emergency related to COVID-19 that ended on 31 March 2022, the Ministry of Health has issued an ordinance (attached in its original Italian) to guide the country in the phase from 1 May – 15 June 2022. <br>
The main ordinance’s provisions are the following: <br>

International Restrictions: <br>
*All travellers: You will need to wear two face masks or a KN95 mask on flights bound for Peru and must complete an <a href=""https://djsaludviajero.minsa.gob.pe/dj-salud/"">affidavit</a>  to enter or travel through Peru as a visitor. <br>
Normally, you don’t need a visa to travel if the purpose of the visit is tourism. If you’re travelling for any other purpose, check entry clearance requirements with the Peruvian Consulate-General. <br>
Immigration: If you enter Peru overland from Ecuador, make sure your passport is stamped with a Peruvian entry stamp at the local immigration office. Most people crossing the border with Ecuador enter Peru through Aguas Verdes (Tumbes region) - you may need to ask for directions to the immigration office. If your passport is not stamped at the border with Ecuador, you can have it stamped at the Immigration Office in the city of Tumbes. <br>
If you enter Peru from Bolivia by bus or taxi, make sure your passport is stamped with a Peruvian entry stamp at the immigration office in Desaguadero or Copacabana (Puno region). Immigration authorities may also not let you leave Peru without a valid exit stamp from the last country you visited. <br>
If you enter Peru without an entry stamp then you’re required by law to apply for a new entry stamp at the nearest immigration office. The immigration authorities will need you to provide your passport and evidence of your entry to Peru, eg air/bus ticket in your name, exit stamp from the last country you visited, and any other documentation they deem necessary. If you’re unable to provide any such evidence you must apply for an exit or expulsion order at the Immigration Office in Lima. You won’t be allowed to leave Peru without this, and you may be prevented from re-entering Peru for the next five to ten years. <br>
The Embassy can’t intervene in immigration issues. Make sure you get your entry stamp when you arrive in Peru, but if your passport was not stamped on entry into Peru, we can assist you in requesting the entry stamp or the exit order. The sooner you start that process, the better. <br>
Please note that passports are not stamped when you enter Peru through Jorge Chavez inter-national airport in Lima. Your details will be recorded in the immigration database and will be available when you leave Peru. <br>
If you’re fully vaccinated: If you’re fully vaccinated, you can enter Peru without needing to test or quarantine. <br>
Passengers aged 12 and over whose final destination is Peru must show evidence of full vaccination received either in Peru or abroad. Those under 12 years old must be without COVID-19 symptoms but do not require a test or proof of vaccination. Adults who reside in Peru must have received the booster (third) dose. These rules are subject to change at short notice.  Anyone who shows COVID-19 symptoms on arrival in Peru must isolate by law. <br>
Proof of vaccination status: You must present proof that you have been fully vaccinated to enter Peru. <br>
Peru will accept the proof of COVID-19 vaccination and that issued in the Crown Dependencies. Although digital proof is accepted, you should also take a hard copy. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.<br>
If you’re not fully vaccinated: Unvaccinated arrivals aged 12 and above, need to show proof of a negative PCR test (taken no more than 48 hours before entry) when entering Peru. <br>
Children and young people: Children aged under 12 do not need to show proof of vaccination to enter Peru. Any child who shows COVID-19 symptoms on arrival in Peru must isolate by law.<br>
If you’re transiting through Peru: Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination. If you are transiting through Peru on your way to another country and staying in the airport (airside) you do not need to meet the vaccination and PCR requirements to enter Peru as above. <br>
If you are transiting through Peru on your way to another country and will be passing through immigration (sometimes known as a layover), for whichever reason, you need to meet the full requirements to enter Peru as above. <br>
Exemptions: There are no exemptions for Peru’s entry requirements.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
 Internal Restrictions: <br>
*Travel in Peru: A state of emergency continues to be in force in Peru due to COVID-19. The Peruvian government operates a four-tier system of restrictions (Extreme, Very High, High and Moderate). There is a requirement to wear two masks (one cloth, one surgical) or a KN95 mask in shops and other indoor public spaces. The use of masks outdoors is optional in some regions, according to its vaccination rates, but still required in others. Please follow local authorities’ instructions.<br>
Adults must show evidence of having received a booster dose to enter most indoor venues, if they reside in Peru. This can be provided on paper or digitally, and foreign vaccination certificates are accepted. Masks must also be worn as specified above. Children aged 5 and over will be allowed to enter sports stadiums and other venues if they show evidence of having been fully vaccinated either in Peru or abroad. All domestic air passengers aged 12 and over will be allowed to board only if they show evidence of having been fully vaccinated either in Peru or abroad. Adults must show evidence of having received a booster dose if they reside in Peru. Alternatively, they can show proof of a negative result from a COVID-19 PCR (molecular) test, issued a maximum of 48 hours before the flight departs. Under 12s old must be without COVID-19 symptoms but do not require a test or proof of vaccination. All interprovincial land transport passengers aged 12 and over must show evidence of full vaccination. Adults must also show evidence of having received a booster dose if they reside in Peru. Alternatively, they can show proof of a negative result from a COVID-19 PCR (molecular) test, issued a maximum of 48 hours before the bus departs. When you show your proof of vaccination, you will be required to show an ID document as well.<br>
For information on the tiers and restrictions in each area, you should visit the El Peruano website. Restrictions may change at short notice – you should follow official guidance and the local media for updates. Fines may be imposed for those breaking the rules.<br>
*Public places and services: Public places and services may be closed, depending on the tier level of the region.<br>

  <br>
International Restrictions: <br>
*All travellers: Testing on arrival: All foreign nationals arriving in South Korea are required to provide a negative PCR test certificate. The PCR test (RT-PCR, LAMP, TMA, SDA, and NEAR DNA amplification-based tests are also valid) must have been taken within the 48 hours prior to departure. As of 23 May 2022, a supervised Rapid Antigen Test (RAT, i.e. lateral flow test) issued by a hospital or clinic within 24 hours prior to departure will also be accepted. If you have recently recovered from COVID-19 in Korea, you may upload a certificate of recovery rather than a negative PCR result into the Q-Code system prior to departure. For all other foreign travellers, it is required to receive a negative PCR/supervised RAT test result as described above before you are able to fly to South Korea. <br>
All arrivals, including children aged 5 and younger, and regardless of nationality and length of stay, are also required to be tested for coronavirus (COVID-19) within 72 hours after entering South Korea. You can reserve an appointment for a PCR test upon arrival at Incheon Airport through the  <a href=""https://www.airport.kr/ap_cnt/en/svc/covid19/medical/medical.do"">Airport Clinic’s website </a>   or take a PCR test within 72 hours of arrival in South Korea at a medical institution near your accommodation or residence. Foreign short-term travellers must pay for a PCR test at either the Airport Clinic or a medical institution while Korean citizens and long-term visa-holders may visit a local public health centre to take a PCR test for free within 72 hours of arrival. <br>
If you have registered your overseas vaccination history through the  <a href=""https://cov19ent.kdca.go.kr/cpassportal/biz/beffatstmnt/main.do?lang=en"">Quarantine COVID19 Defence (Q-Code) system</a> before traveling to Korea, you may proceed to your final destination by public transport and take a PCR test within 72 hours (see ‘Quarantine requirements’ below). If your test is positive, you must comply with self-quarantine and treatment instructions issued by the Korean authorities. You will be required to stay at a quarantine centre for 7 days (if you are a short-term visitor) or to isolate at home (if you are a long-term resident and if your accommodation meets certain standards). You will not need to take another PCR test at the end of your quarantine. For more information contact the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency on 1339 from inside South Korea (support is available in English). <br>
*Quarantine requirements: Vaccinated travellers who have completed their COVID-19 vaccination in Korea or have completed vaccination overseas and have registered their vaccination history through the  <a href=""https://cov19ent.kdca.go.kr/cpassportal/biz/beffatstmnt/main.do?lang=en"">Quarantine COVID19 Defence (Q-Code) system</a> before traveling to Korea will be eligible for quarantine exemption. Vaccination is considered to be complete and remains valid indefinitely 14 days after the 2nd shot for a two-dose vaccine. <br>
For those who have not completed vaccination or who have not registered their vaccination history through the Q-Code system, the default requirement when entering South Korea is to quarantine for seven days at home (if you are resident in South Korea) or in a government quarantine facility (if you are visiting). You can avoid quarantine entirely if you register your vaccination status through the  <a href=""https://cov19ent.kdca.go.kr/cpassportal/biz/beffatstmnt/main.do?lang=en"">Quarantine COVID19 Defence (Q-Code) system</a> or if you have a ‘quarantine exemption’ certificate issued by a Korean embassy. <br>
If you’re visiting and must quarantine, you can quarantine with relatives if you can prove your relationship to them and if their accommodation meets certain standards. If you must quarantine and are a Korean national or long-term foreign resident with an Alien Registration Card and Korean residence, you may self-quarantine at home. <br>
Foreign short-term travellers who are not eligible for quarantine exemption may be able to quarantine with family members under specific circumstances. Your family member must be your spouse or a “lineal” family member (parents/grandparents or children/grandchildren, not a sibling) of you or your spouse and must be resident in Korea (i.e. a Korean national or a foreigner with a long-term stay visa). You must be able to prove your family relationship, for example by showing your ID, a copy of your family member’s Korean ID, and a marriage or birth certificate, which must be legalised (or “apostilled”). Certified translations are required for documents not in English. Your family’s accommodation must meet certain basic standards (typically, they must have a separate bedroom and a separate bathroom for you). Your family must also be available to pick you up from the airport or the quarantine facility. These rules may change at short notice – your family member in Korea should double-check the rules before you travel by calling the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency on 1339 (support is available in English). <br>
Foreign short-term travellers who are unvaccinated or who have not registered their vaccination history through the <a href=""https://cov19ent.kdca.go.kr/cpassportal/biz/beffatstmnt/main.do?lang=en"">Quarantine COVID19 Defence (Q-Code) system</a> must quarantine at a government-designated facility for seven days. Individuals are required to pay a daily charge of around 120,000KRW while in government quarantine facilities. <br>
Onward travel from the airport: If you are an unvaccinated, short-term visitor quarantining with family members, your family members must pick you up from the airport or from a quarantine facility later. <br>
Quarantine transport options are available from the airport for unvaccinated travellers. Guidance is available at the airport on how best to proceed to your destination. Vaccinated travellers may proceed to their final destination by public transport. <br>
Data collection: Individuals will be tested for COVID-19 on arrival, and will need to participate with an active monitoring system via regular calls with a health expert and a specialised mobile app. <br>
Make sure you have with you a mobile telephone with the roaming function enabled, and/or the telephone number of a friend, relative or contact who can update the authorities daily on your state of health. A hotel telephone number will not be accepted. Immigration authorities will undertake a test call before travellers leave the airport, and any individual unable to verify their contact details may be denied entry to South Korea. <br>
*If you’re fully vaccinated: Quarantine exemption availability: Vaccinated travellers who have completed their COVID-19 vaccination in Korea or have completed vaccination overseas and have registered their vaccination history through the <a href=""https://cov19ent.kdca.go.kr/cpassportal/biz/beffatstmnt/main.do?lang=en"">Quarantine COVID19 Defence (Q-Code) system</a> before traveling to Korea will be eligible for quarantine exemption. Vaccination is considered to be complete and remains valid indefinitely 14 days after the 2nd shot for a two-dose vaccine. <br>
Entrants from certain countries may be excluded from exemption, even if fully vaccinated. Check the <a href=""http://ncov.mohw.go.kr/en/tcmBoardList.do?brdId=12&brdGubun=125&dataGubun=&ncvContSeq=&contSeq=&board_id="">Ministry of Health and Welfare’s website  </a> for further details. <br>
Unvaccinated individuals may be able to apply for Quarantine Exemptions from Korean embassies in some circumstances.
Proof of vaccination status: You do not need to demonstrate proof of overseas vaccination in order to enter South Korea, however, if you do not register completed overseas vaccinations through the Q-Code system, you will be expected to quarantine for seven days. If you were vaccinated in South Korea, your vaccination status will be automatically linked to the Q-Code system from the COOV database. All arrivals are required to be tested. <br>
*If you’re not fully vaccinated: There are no special provisions for unvaccinated individuals. If you’ve had COVID-19 in the past year: If you have recently recovered from COVID-19, you will still need to receive a negative PCR or supervised RAT (lateral flow test) result. You should bring with you an official note from your doctor detailing when you tested positive, what treatment you received and/or what isolation you observed. If you test positive or inconclusive on arrival, Korean officials will consider this information when deciding how to proceed. Some Foreign Nationals have tested negative in their country and then tested positive on arrival in South Korea. Korean health officials have broad discretion in deciding what precautions are required and you may be required to quarantine even if you are no longer testing positive. Otherwise, there are no special provisions for individuals who have had COVID-19 in the past year. <br>
*Children and young people: Children aged 17 and under can follow the rules for All travellers’ to enter South Korea.
There are some exceptions to the requirement for children to present a pre-departure PCR test on arrival. Parents should note that young children are required to take a PCR test within 72 hours of arriving in South Korea, in line with the rules for adults. <br>
Unvaccinated children aged 11 and younger do not need to quarantine if accompanied by family members whose vaccinations are registered through the <a href=""https://cov19ent.kdca.go.kr/cpassportal/biz/beffatstmnt/main.do?lang=en"">Quarantine COVID19 Defence (Q-Code) system</a>.
*If you’re transiting through South Korea: Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination. <br>
All transit passengers receive a temperature check on arrival in Korea. Symptomatic individuals will be subject to a COVID-19 test and hospitalisation if found positive. Passengers who do not show symptoms and/or test negative may continue their journey. <br>
Transit passengers at Seoul Incheon Airport require a ticket/boarding pass for their onward flight to their final destination. They should confirm with the airline(s) before departure that their bags have been checked through to their final destination (as transit passengers are not able to collect and re-check in baggage on arrival in Incheon Airport). <br>
Transit hotels are available in both Terminals 1 and 2 at Incheon Airport. A “layover” – i.e. passing through immigration to enter South Korea during a long gap between flights – is not possible in South Korea, as everyone who enters the country through immigration must proceed directly into the COVID-19 testing system and is subject, in most cases, to a seven day quarantine requirement. <br>
*Exemptions from pre-departure COVID-19 tests: Children aged five and under are not required to provide a negative PCR test certificate on arrival in South Korea. Individuals with quarantine exemptions issued by a Korean embassy for “humanitarian reasons” (i.e. to attend a funeral) or official business reasons are also exempt. <br>
*Quarantine exemptions: For overseas unvaccinated travellers arriving in South Korea, quarantine exemptions will be issued from Korean embassies only for attendance at the funeral of a close family member. You can apply for a quarantine exemption via the Korean Embassy in the country where you are resident. “Family member” is defined as your spouse, a sibling of you or your spouse, or a “lineal” family member (parents/grandparents or children/grandchildren) of you or your spouse. <br>
If you are unvaccinated and are travelling to Korea for business, your employer can apply for a Quarantine Exemption Certificate through the <a href=""http://www.btsc.or.kr/"">Business Support Centre</a> (in Korean). <br>
Vaccinated travellers who have completed vaccination overseas and have registered their vaccination history through the 
<a href=""https://cov19ent.kdca.go.kr/cpassportal/biz/beffatstmnt/main.do?lang=en"">Quarantine COVID19 Defence (Q-Code) system</a> before traveling to Korea will be eligible for quarantine exemption.<br>

*Testing positive for COVID-19: If you think you might have COVID-19 while in South Korea, you should self-isolate immediately and contact the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency on 1339 for guidance (support is available in English). Outdoor sites where you can receive a free test are common in most cities. If you are eligible to receive a PCR test, you will usually receive your results via text message within 1-2 days. If you are not eligible to receive a PCR test, you will receive an antigen test which provides results within approximately 30 minutes. <br>
If you test positive for COVID-19, you must comply with self-quarantine and treatment instructions issued by the Korean authorities. The Korean authorities have made clear that if you have no or mild symptoms you will generally be eligible for quarantine and treatment at home, unless you are unable to sufficiently isolate from others. If the Korean authorities judge it necessary, you will be moved to a quarantine centre or a hospital/treatment centre. There is currently no charge for quarantine centre stays or for medical care in a hospital/treatment centre as long as you have not violated any quarantine measures. Fully vaccinated individuals will generally need to quarantine (whether at home or in a facility) for seven days. Korean health authorities generally have broad discretion to apply the rules as they see fit. You may face additional costs from your travel provider if you have to rearrange your travel. <br>
Anyone displaying symptoms or returning a positive test result for COVID-19 must comply with self-quarantine and treatment instructions issued by the Korean authorities. Failure to do so could result in imprisonment, deportation, the revocation of visas or residence permits and an entry ban, and you may be held liable for the cost of your treatment and for any economic losses incurred by further transmission of the virus. The Ministry of Justice has made clear that this policy applies to foreign residents as well as short-term visitors.

The following requirements apply regardless of vaccination status. <br>
Russian government requires all arriving passengers to carry a negative COVID-19 (PCR) test result dated within 48 hours before arrival in Russia. Airlines may require you to show this on check-in, and airlines may require for your COVID-19 (PCR) test to be taken within 48 hours before arrival in Russia (please check with your airline). If a passenger arrives in Russia without a negative PCR test, they should have the test done within 48 hours from their arrival and self-isolate until they receive a negative PCR test. <br>
Additional requirements apply to foreigners who enter Russia from the Eurasian Economic Union countries (Russia, Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan) and some CIS countries (Azerbaijan, Moldova, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan) by air. Passengers arriving from these countries are required to receive a negative PCR COVID-19 test via the “Travelling without COVID-19” app and present the test result on the smartphone upon arrival. This does not apply to transit passengers travelling to Russia through the above countries. From 8 December 2021, they are required to present a certificate for a negative PCR test, with the result being within 48 hours before their arrival in Russia and a proof of travel (tickets and/or boarding passes) for the entire route. <br>
You should check the specific COVID-19 test requirements airlines have in place in advance of your flight. Airlines may refuse boarding if their requirements are not met. <br>
*Testing/screening on arrival: Passengers arriving by air may be temperature-checked and/or randomly selected for additional PCR testing on arrival. No prior arrangements are required. Passengers should follow guidance of the Russian authorities upon landing. <br>

*By road: There are no immigration check points on the land border between Russia and Belarus so foreigners (including British nationals) who cross the land border between Russia and Belarus will have no stamps in their passports and will be deemed to have entered illegally. If you’re planning on driving to Russia, you’ll need to take an alternative route through a different country. <br>
*By rail: If you’re planning on travelling by rail between the two countries, you should contact your train or tour operator when you make your booking to seek their advice to avoid entering Russia without passing through immigration and thus being deemed to have entered Russia illegally. You should also consider contacting your nearest Russian embassy or consulate for advice on the latest situation for rail travellers. <br>
Due to COVID restrictions, travel across Russian land border with Belarus is currently permitted to Russian and Belarus nationals only. You should make sure you have all the necessary visas for the duration of your travel. <br>

Symptomatic cases, especially for those in ‘high-risk’ categories will be cared for in a health-managed isolation facility.
*Asymptomatic Cases: Asymptomatic/mildly symptomatic cases must undergo isolation at a certified tourism accommodation establishment at their own cost. People who are asymptomatic throughout their self-isolation can expect to self-isolate for 10 days, while mildly symptomatic visitors must self-isolate for 14 days. Guests may not change accommodation during a period of self-isolation without the permission of the Public Health Authority. <br>
If parents are required to self-isolate, then minors will be expected to stay with them or with other family members. Unaccompanied minors (i.e. under 18 years of age) will normally be treated as adults.<br>

Applicants will be required to complete an <a href=""https://visawebapp.boca.gov.tw/BOCA_EVISA/"">online visa application form</a> and to submit the required documentation to the Bureau of Consular Affairs (BOCA) for consideration. <br>
In addition, exceptions apply for the following groups: ARC/APRC/Gold Card holders, business travellers, foreign spouses of Taiwan passport holders and their children under the age of 20, foreign relatives of Taiwan passport holders, international students and foreign professors and researchers. <br>
All foreign nationals will be required to have obtained the correct entry permissions and a visa before they arrive in Taiwan. Currently there is no set date for when these border measures will be lifted. Exceptions may be made for emergency or humanitarian reasons. You should contact your local Taipei Representative Office for further information. Anyone entering Taiwan will be required to follow the quarantine requirements set out below. <br>
All passengers travelling to Taiwan will be required to follow the quarantine and testing requirements set out below. <br>
Screening on arrival: All passengers arriving or transiting in Taiwan are required to present a certificate of a negative COVID-19 RT-PCR test taken within two calendar days of boarding their flight to Taiwan. The test will be calculated based on the “specimen collection date” not the test report date. Any exemption due to exceptional circumstances will require prior approval before departure. <br>
Test Certificates of a negative COVID-19 RT-PCR must be issued by a recognised medical institution in the country of departure and include the following information: <br>
•        the passenger’s full name as per their passport, <br>
•        the date of birth or passport number of the traveller, <br>
•        specimen collection date and test report date, <br>
•        the virus name, testing method and the test result <br>
Test Certificates are required to be produced in either English or Chinese; however, in situations where the passenger provides a certificate in either French or Spanish, if the certificate is in the official language of the place of departure, and ground personnel of the airline are able to assist with the inspection of the content, the certificate may be accepted. <br>
All passengers arriving in Taiwan will be required to undergo a COVID-19 saliva test upon arrival before being permitted to proceed to their pre-arranged quarantine facility. If the COVID-19 saliva test comes back positive, passengers undergoing quarantine at their residential property will be notified and permitted to undergo home care at the same location during their quarantine period. Passengers who test positive and are quarantining at a designated quarantine hotel will be notified and transferred to an enhanced epidemic prevention hotel, designated quarantine centre or hospital for further treatment. The decision regarding these arrangements will be made by the <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov.tw/En"">Taiwan Centers for Disease Control</a> and will depend on the severity of your symptoms. <br>
Anyone found to provide false or incorrect test results, or evade or obstruct the quarantine measures, may face a fine of between NT$10,000 to NT$150,000 and further criminal charges.<br>

At present, entry to Turkmenistan is prohibited except for Turkmen nationals and accredited diplomats, permanently registered foreigners and some employees of international companies and organisations. <br>
You will need a visa and letter of invitation (LOI) to enter or travel through Turkmensitan as a visitor. <br>
You should consult your embassy in advance of your intended travel date. All visa applications made at Turkmen Embassies can take 20 days or more. There is an accelerated 24 hour service, but a supplementary fee of approximately US$150 will be charged. <br>
You will need a letter of invitation (LOI), certified by the State Migration Service of Turkmenistan, from a private individual or company to support your application. For tourists, these can be obtained from authorised travel agents. A list is available from the British Embassy in Ashgabat. Those travelling on business for the first time must obtain letters from relevant ministries, departments or companies they wish to co-operate with, unless the visit is made to attend an exhibition or other event, in which case the organiser normally provides visa support.<br>
Without prior approval from the Turkmen authorities, it is not possible to enter Turkmenistan. It is possible to buy a visa on arrival at either Ashgabat and Turkmenabad airports or the ferry port at Turkmenbashi but only if you have approval from the Turkmenistan Migration Service before arrival. If you break your journey or try to enter Turkmenistan without the right visa you will face a long and uncomfortable wait in the offices of the Immigration Service at the airport or ferry port. <br>
In addition to a visa fee, there are charges of up to US$150 for vehicles entering Turkmenistan by either land or sea. These can include elements for disinfection, an entry permit, insurance and a compensatory amount for fuel subsidies operating in Turkmenistan. The rate is changeable and varies depending on the entry point, the type of vehicle, its engine capacity and distance you intend to travel. All are payable in cash in US Dollars on entry. <br>
If you are staying for more than 3 days you should register with the State Migration Service of Turkmenistan. Don’t overstay your visa. <br>
All foreign nationals need a visa to transit Turkmenistan. You can be registered at entry and exit points if your stay is not longer than five days and you hold a valid transit visa. But you won’t be able to change your transit visa in-country, and you must notify the authorities if you intend to vary your route through the country. <br>
If you intend to travel from Turkmenistan to Azerbaijan across the Caspian Sea you should be aware that it is not possible to buy a visa on arrival at Baku seaport. Make sure you have a valid visa to enter Azerbaijan if you take the ferry. <br>
On arrival, you must pay a US$14 migration fee ($10 fee plus $4 Admin charge).
You must register within three days of arrival with the State Migration Service of Turkmenistan at their office at 57 Azadi Street, Ashgabat. Registration is for the period of the visa and may be carried out on your behalf. If you are not staying in Ashgabat, you should register at the local department of Migration Service instead. You should bring two passport size photos. The State Migration Service of Turkmenistan will need a letter confirming your departure from Turkmenistan. A de-registration stamp in your passport is no longer required. <br>
Non-compliance with these requirements could lead to prosecution and possible detention. <br>
Single parents or other adults travelling alone with children should contact their embassy for advice about the documents that will be required at immigration. <br>
If you intend to enter Turkmenistan with medicines, whether prescription or non-prescription, you should check in advance the list of prohibited medicines and the legal quantities of medicines that are allowed into the country. If you’re in any doubt, check this with your embassy before the travel. <br>
Substances of concern to the Turkmen authorities include but are not limited to tramadol, morphine, opiates or any other constituent competent that may be considered as a narcotic drug or psychotropic agent. Possession of these items can lead to administrative or criminal proceedings if you don’t have a prescription, or if you’re carrying more than you need for your visit and don’t declare them on arrival. <br>
If you’re travelling with prescription medicines, you should carry a doctor’s prescription and declare the items on your customs declaration form. Some medicines that are non-prescription in your country, including codeine, can cause problems on entry into Turkmenistan. Issues have been reported at both the international airport and land borders. <br>
You won’t be able to enter or transit Turkmenistan using a UK Emergency Travel Document (ETD).

You can end self-isolation early if you receive a negative PCR or Rapid Antigen test result. <br>
Unvaccinated travellers (with certain exceptions listed on <a href=""http://visitukraine.today/"">Visit Ukraine</a>) who travel from Russia (including for transit through Ukraine) and have spent 7 or more days of the previous 14 days in those countries, will have to self-isolate for 14 days and will not be able to take a test in Ukraine to avoid or reduce self-isolation. <br>

International Restrictions:  <br>
*All travellers: You will need to get a visa or an Electronic System for Travel Authorisation (ESTA) visa waiver to enter or transit the USA as a visitor. You should consult the <a href=""https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas.html"">US State Department website  </a>to determine which you will need. <br>
You should be aware that if you have travelled to or have been in Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen on or after 1 March 2011, you are normally not eligible for an ESTA visa waiver and will need to apply for a US visa. <br>
The US Embassy advise that travellers who come under the following categories should not attempt to travel on an ESTA and should instead apply for a visa: those who have been arrested (even if the arrest did not result in a criminal conviction); those who have a criminal record; those who have been refused admission into, or have been deported from the USA; those who have previously overstayed under an ESTA. <br>
*If you’re fully vaccinated: Most fully vaccinated foreign citizens can enter the USA. The US authorities will accept any COVID-19 vaccine approved for emergency use by the World Health Organisation or approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

Internal Restrictions: <br>
*Travel in USA: Many airports in the USA have implemented safety measures designed to limit the spread of COVID-19. You should check the website of the airport you are flying into or transiting to see how these could affect you. <br>
On 21 January 2021 President Biden signed an Executive Order requiring masks to be worn on public transport including airplanes, trains, buses and at airports. <br>
A number of US states no longer mandate the use of masks and face coverings while in public. However, the guidance will vary from state to state and there can often be different rules within different localities in the same state. You should consult the website of the state or city to which you are travelling. Further details are found on the  
<a href=""https://www.usa.gov/states-and-territories"">USA.GOV</a> site. Penalties for breaches of regulations will vary between each state and may sometimes vary in different areas in the same state. <br>
Some areas require proof of vaccination in order to access local amenities. In certain localities, children 5 to 17 years may not be exempt from this requirement. Some private venues, including restaurants and concert halls, have made proof of vaccination (or a recent negative COVID-19 test result) a requirement for entry. The precise requirements may vary from venue to venue so you should check on compliancy requirements in advance. <br>
*Accommodation: Hotels will be operating at capacities dictated by local rules and regulations. <br>
Public places and services: Local regulations on shops, restaurants, bars, beaches and other leisure activities may be following measures designed to limit the spread of COVID-19. Some areas require proof of vaccination or evidence of a negative COVID-19 test in order to access local amenities. In certain localities, children aged 5 to 17 years may not be exempt from this requirement. <br>
*If you test positive while in the USA, you may be required to isolate in a private area, likely a hotel or a private residence. Isolation requirements will depend on the guidance in the state where you are residing/visiting. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends a minimum isolation period of at least five full days. Any assistance for those required to quarantine will depend on the local authority. You should check the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) <a href=https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/travel-planner/index.html"""">travel planner</a> to verify local state guidance.

  <br>
 International Restrictions: <br>
 *All travellers: You don’t need a visa to enter The Occupied Palestinian Territories as a tourist. On entry, visitors are granted permission to stay for a period of up to 3 months. <br>
Visitors entering via Tel Aviv Ben Gurion Airport are given an entry card instead of an entry stamp in their passport. While this practice is in place at other ports of entry, there have been instances where passports have been stamped for entry purposes. You should keep your entry card with your passport until you leave. This is evidence of your legal entry into Israel and may be required, particularly at any crossing points into the Occupied Palestinian Territories. If you’re refused entry into Israel, your passport may be stamped with an entry stamp and two red lines drawn across it to indicate the refusal.
It is for the Israeli authorities to decide if you can enter Israel. If you have any particular concerns about visas or entry into Israel, you should contact the Israeli embassy. If you work in Israel without the proper permissions, you can be detained and then deported, a process which could take several months. Consular staff will not be able to help you enter Israel or the Occupied Palestinian Territories. They are unable get involved in another country’s immigration policy or procedures. <br>
At the Allenby Bridge crossing with Jordan, and at Tel Aviv Ben Gurion Airport, Israeli border officials have sometimes used an entry stamp for certain travellers that states ‘Palestinian Authority only’ or ‘Judea and Samaria only’. Since travellers entering via the Allenby Bridge crossing must pass through Israeli checkpoints and Israeli-controlled territory to reach Jerusalem or Gaza, this restriction effectively limits travellers who receive this stamp. It is not clear how a traveller receiving the stamp at Tel Aviv Ben Gurion Airport can leave the airport without violating the restriction. This stamp has been issued to travellers who have no Palestinian or other Arab ancestry, and who would not seem to have any claim to a Palestinian Authority ID. <br>
Israeli border officials at Tel Aviv Ben Gurion Airport have also at times required certain travellers to sign a form that states that he/she is not allowed to enter territories controlled by the Palestinian Authority unless he/she obtains advance authorisation from the Israeli ‘Territory Actions Co-ordinator’, and that violating this restriction may result in the traveller being deported from Israel and barred from entry for up to 10 years. In March 2017 the Israeli Parliament passed a law which gives authority to deny entry to foreign nationals who have publicly called for a boycott of Israel and/or settlements, or who belong to an organisation which has called for a boycott. if you need further information. <br>
Emergency Travel Documents: Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are not valid for entry into Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories unless the holder is a returning resident. However, ETDs are accepted for airside transit and exit from Israel. <br>
Previous Travel to Other Countries: Evidence of a previous visit to another country in the region like an entry/exit stamp in your passport does not normally prevent entry into Israel, although it may lead to additional questioning at the border. It is for the Israeli authorities to determine the right of entry into Israel, so if you have any particular concerns about previous travel to another country, you should contact the nearest Israeli Embassy. <br>
Customs and Immigration: You should expect lengthy personal questioning and baggage searches by security officials on arrival and departure from Israel. Electrical items, including laptops, may be taken from departing passengers for security inspection and either stored in the aircraft baggage hold, or returned to you in the UK. Damage may occur. <br>
If you arrive with valuable personal items (computers, camcorders etc.) you may be required to pay a deposit that is refundable on or after departure. <br>
Israeli security officials have on occasion requested access to travellers’ personal e-mail accounts or other social media accounts as a condition of entry. <br>
Entering the Occupied Palestinian Territories: Entry to the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPTs), including by sea to Gaza, is controlled by the Israeli authorities. You must produce a passport and immigration slip, to cross between Israel and the OPTs. <br>
You may be detained on arrival and deported if you are intending to enter Gaza without permission. If you’re entering the country for the purpose of working in the OPTs, you may be refused entry. <br>
For more information, contact the nearest Israeli Embassy. <br>
Foreign nationals of Palestinian origin: If you’re a foreign national of Palestinian origin (on the Palestinian Population Register or holding a Palestinian ID number), you will need a Palestinian passport or travel document in order to leave. If you are a Foreign national with a Palestinian name or place of birth but without a Palestinian ID number, you may face problems. A number of Foreign nationals of Palestinian origin married to Palestinians have been refused entry to the country. <br>
Dual nationals: Foreign-Palestinian dual nationals living in the West Bank and Gaza are allowed to travel abroad only via the Rafah or Allenby Bridge border crossings into Egypt or Jordan and return via the same route. <br>
*If you’re fully vaccinated: If you’re fully vaccinated, you can enter Israel/The Occupied Palestinian Territories. No proof of vaccination is required. <br>
All travellers must have a health insurance policy with coverage for the treatment of COVID-19. The insurance policy is mandatory to enter Israel. <br>
