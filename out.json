Sample processing could take several days. If your subsequent PCR result is positive you must remain in government quarantine. It is likely you will have to remain in quarantine until you have two consecutive negative PCR results. Quarantine may last 14 days or longer. You should be prepared for travel restrictions, and changes to screening and precautionary observation requirements with no advance notice.\nThere is a high risk of being put into 14 days of quarantine, either on arrival or during your trip to Liberia. \nYou are at risk of being put into quarantine or instructed to self-isolate for 14 days even after you have arrived in Liberia, if you develop symptoms (fever, cough or respiratory illness), or it is suspected you have been in contact with some who has tested positive for coronavirus. If you test positive for COVID-19, you may be transferred to a government treatment centre. You are strongly advised to familiarise yourself with these risks before travelling. All foreign citizens in quarantine or self-isolation will have their passports removed and held by the National Public Health Institute of Liberia (NPHIL) for 14 days. You will be given a copy of your passport to retain whilst in quarantine. If you are travelling on behalf of government, an international organisation/NGO or a company, you should check with your organisation whether they have pre-arranged a private POC, i.e. quarantine facility, authorised by NHPIL. The British Embassy cannot provide POC facilities. If you show symptoms, you may be transferred to quarantine or a government treatment centre Visitors arriving on a laissez-passer (except UN or EU), may also be taken to quarantine for secondary screening. Any suspicion of illegal attempts to circumvent the process will result in 14 days of quarantine.\n\nPublic health requirements for humanitarian flighs [https://humanitarianbooking.wfp.org/en/wfp-aviation/]\n\n*****Internal restrictions:\nA nationwide State of Emergency, which includes a range of measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus, has been extended effective from 22 June to 21 July, pending Legislature approval.
