Returning residents will be subject to strict health screening and 21-day self-quarantine. Entry exceptions may also be applied to citizens bringing remittances from abroad. ravellers arriving from countries with confirmed COVID-19 cases will be subject to medical screening upon arrival. Travellers arriving from countries with local transmission cases (as referenced by the WHO) are advised to self-quarantine for a period of 21 days. Travellers with signs and symptoms of COVID-19 will be subject to immediate isolation at a medical facility upon arrival. All travellers should obtain a medical certificate proving that they are clear of COVID-19 prior to travel to Zimbabwe; there is potential, based on a passenger\u2019s nationality and recent travel history, that they may be asked at immigration to produce such a certificate in order to be granted entry. Anecdotal evidence suggests that passengers arriving from countries without confirmed COVID-19 cases or a \u201clow\u201d number of cases will not be required to present a certificate, however the authorities have not produced a specific list. Furthermore, authorities have asked travellers who have recently been to or are arriving from countries such as China, Iran, Italy and South Korea, to suspend travel to Zimbabwe, as they are likely to be refused entry. For profile and itinerary-specific information, travellers are advised to contact the relevant airline, or the nearest Zimbabwean Embassy. Anyone displaying a symptom associated with coronavirus will be placed in a Government of Zimbabwe facility for testing. Anyone who tests positive will be treated in a Government of Zimbabwe treatment centre. Reports suggest that some foreign nationals are being quarantined for 21 days on arrival at Harare airport despite testing negative for coronavirus (COVID-19). Anyone accompanying dead bodies of relatives from outside the country must undergo quarantine for 21 days before the burial. The same applies to cases where the body is transiting through Mozambique.\n\nInternal restrictions:\nTroops, police tighten COVID-19 lockdown in Harare (Reuters, 02.06.2020)\nPresident Mnangagwa has classified COVID-19 as a \u2018National Disaster;\u2019 this allows authorities to deploy resources in combatting the pandemic and also allows the government to forbid gatherings exceeding 100 people. A nationwide lockdown is in place until further notice. The restrictions will be reassessed every two weeks. During this period, people will only be allowed to leave their home to purchase necessary supplies such as food and medicine, and seek medical care. Exceptions may be applied to farmers delivering their products to markets and citizens bringing remittances from abroad. Some internal measures will ease from 4 May; formal companies will be allowed to operate from 08.00 to 16.30 and public busses will be allowed to transport passengers provided they observe social distancing, wear masks, and that buses have thermometers to screen passengers. During the lockdown, the military will be deployed to ensure that the population complies with restrictions. Shops in Matabeleland South Province are now limiting the quantities being purchased per customer due to declining supplies of basic commodities. People are required to wear masks outside their homes. \n", "#severity+date+travel": "02.06.2020", "#value+cbpf+covid+funding+total+usd": "", "#value+cerf+covid+funding+total+usd": "",
